In this part of the repository, you can access the datasets that can be used to model human mobility.
You can explore two different categories of datasets: the ones strictly related to human mobility and others that cannot be used to directly model mobility but are strictly related to it.
Regarding the former, you can access the following categories

- [Human Mobility](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/human_mobility.md)
    - [Mobile Phone Records](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/human_mobility.md#mobile-phone)
    - [GPS Traces](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/human_mobility.md#gps)
    - [Social Media](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/human_mobility.md#social-media)
    - [Others](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/human_mobility.md#others)

While the auxiliary datasets are orgnanized as follows

- [Auxiliary](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/auxiliary.md)
    - [Spatial Aggregations](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/auxiliary.md#spatial-aggregations)
    - [Traffic](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/auxiliary.md#traffic)
    - [Environment](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/auxiliary.md#environment)
    - [Census and Administrative](https://github.com/scikit-mobility/DeepLearning4HumanMobility/blob/master/Datasets/auxiliary.md#census-and-administrative)
