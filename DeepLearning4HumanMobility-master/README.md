# [Deep Learning for Human Mobility: a Survey on Data and Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02825)



This document aims to track the progress in the usage of Deep Learning (DL) applied to human mobility and give an overview of the state-of-the-art across the most common tasks and their corresponding datasets. In particular, we want to provide the users with a list of papers and they key characteristics (e.g., DL component(s) used in the model, metric(s) adopted for the evaluation and others) and, whenever it is open, a link to the dataset used in the paper.

Moreover, we provide a list of datasources that can be used to model human mobility (e.g., Call Detail Records, GPS trajectories, Location Based Social Networks) and others that are not representing mobility but are strictly related to it and may be taken into account to finetune predictions (e.g., weather conditions, traffic data and others).

This repository is based on the findings discussed in *Deep Learning for Human Mobility: a Survey on Data and Models* a paper by Massimiliano Luca, Gianni Barlacchi, Bruno Lepri and Luca Pappalardo. If you use the content of this repository or if you want to further investigate this topic using the survey, please cite our work as
